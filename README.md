Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction using Machine Learning
This project predicts whether a sonar signal indicates a rock or a mine using machine learning. It implements a Logistic Regression model and provides an interactive GUI using Tkinter for users to input sonar data manually or load from a file.

Overview
The Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction model is trained on the SONAR dataset, which consists of 60 features representing sonar readings. The system classifies the readings into one of two categories:

R: Rock
M: Mine
The project includes:

Logistic Regression-based classification model.
Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction.
Options to load data from files or enter manually.
Dataset
The dataset used for training is Sonar Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of:

60 continuous features.
2 target classes: 'R' for Rock, 'M' for Mine.
Technologies Used
Python 3.6+
pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn (for data processing and model creation)
Tkinter (for building the GUI)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sonar-rock-vs-mine-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd sonar-rock-vs-mine-prediction
Install dependencies: Make sure you have Python installed. Then install the necessary libraries by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you do not have a requirements.txt file, here are the core dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
Usage
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python rock_vs_mine_prediction.py
Using the GUI:

Manual Input: Enter 60 feature values into the input fields manually and click Predict.
Load from File: Click Load Input Data to load a CSV or TXT file containing 60 comma-separated feature values.
Prediction:

The application will display whether the sonar signal corresponds to a Rock or a Mine.
The background color changes to blue for Rock and red for Mine.
GUI Interface
The Tkinter GUI is built to allow easy interaction for users to input sonar features and receive predictions from the trained model.
